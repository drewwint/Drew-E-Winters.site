abstract: "**Background** Impaired affective theory of mind for complex stimuli predicts violent criminal behavior amongst adolescents with callous-unemotional (CU) traits. CU traits are a youth antisocial phenotype counterpart to adult psychopathy present between 17-26% of community youth that cost U.S. society over $2 trillion annually; yet, available treatments for these youth have limited efficacy. Cognitive control is a potentially important, yet understudied, treatment target to address CU trait impairments in complex affective theory of mind. Affective theory of mind involves making inferences about others’ emotions that can be basic (e.g., happy, sad, mad) or complex (e.g., nervous, shame, annoyance). Complex affective states are subtle, which, to process, require greater cognitive control resources. Cognitive control modulates theory of mind; and research on CU traits demonstrates impairments in both cognitive control and complex affective theory of mind. Despite the connections made in the literature, the impact of cognitive control impairments on affective theory of mind amongst youth with CU traits remains understudied. The failure to process others complex affective states may explain how those with CU traits callously harm others and engage in criminal acts; therefore, investigating cognitive controls impact on affective theory of mind impairments can reveal neurocognitive targets that inform new evidence-based therapeutics. Given that adult psychopathy is considered a neurodevelopmental disorder[23], it is critical to examine early adolescents, the earliest that theory of mind is consistently accurate[24], to capture mechanisms of these core impairments early. There is considerable evidence that CU traits are present on a continuous scale amongst community samples, which demonstrate the same neurocognitive impairments as clinical/forensic samples. Thus, we examined a community sample of early adolescents in a pilot study designed to determine cognitive controls impact on theory of mind as a function of CU traits. **Methods** We recruited 87 early adolescents (ages 12-14) from the community (1:1 ratio of sex) oversampled for high CU traits to participate in behavioral tasks. Behavioral tasks included an affective theory of mind task with basic and complex emotions and an inhibitory processing task (to tax cognitive control). For recruitment we determined high versus normal CU traits using the inventory of CU traits low prosocial emotion specifier. Given that cognitive control depends on the current load on cognitive resources, cognitive control can be manipulated by placing a cognitive load on cognitive resources. Thus, the design involved a baseline theory of mind, then a cognitive load, and a final post-cognitive load theory of mind task. We conducted three separate analyses. First, to test effects of taxing cognitive control, we used a linear mixed effects model across repeated measures of complex theory of mind as a function of CU traits specifying random effects for individuals. Second, to test response to cognitive load, we used a linear regression with the maximum amount of cognitive load responded to as a function of CU traits. Third, we used linear regressions with basic and complex affective theory of mind as functions of CU traits. For all analyses we adjusted for sex, age, and race. A priori 80% power calculations using a two tailed test with p < 0.05 revealed a mixed effects model required 62 participants and regressions required 81 participants. **Results** Mixed effects model revealed that increases in CU traits associated with a greater mean difference from baseline to post cognitive load on complex affective theory of mind (F= 4.07, p= 0.021), and the cognitive load had a higher impact on the slope for complex affective theory of mind judgements (β= –0.11, p= 0.018, marginal R2= 0.113, conditional R2= 0.591). Second, increases in CU traits associated with lower levels of cognitive load responded to (β= -21.57, p= 0.032, R2= 0.100). Third, increases in CU traits did not associate with basic emotions but did associate with significant lower accuracy during complex affective theory of mind (β= –0.102, p= 0.009, R2= 0.149). **Conclusion** Results suggest 1) higher levels of CU traits associate with general impairments in cognitive control resources, 2) impairments in complex affective theory of mind are accentuated after placing a cognitive load on cognitive control, and 3) these effects are specific to complex affective theory of mind. Future research could examine neural mechanisms underlying these findings by taking this behavioral paradigm into an fMRI, which will set the stage for refining neural targets for new evidenced-based therapeutics targeting affective theory of mind in early adolescents with CU traits."
