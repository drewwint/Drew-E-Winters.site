Executive functioning is a ubiquitous and transdiagnostic factor across mental health symptoms - and implications in youth antisocial phenotypes are mixed. This project seeks to determine distinctions in executive functions betwen distinct (yet related) antisocial phenotypes as well as their contributions to charactistic impairments vis implicated brain properties.
