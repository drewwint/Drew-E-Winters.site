Goal: A primary concern for antisocial behavior in youth with callous-unemotional traits is the associated difficulty with processing the emotions of others. The aim of this project is to elucidate specific impairments in neurocognitive function associated with callous-unemotional traits and their impact on processing other's emotions.
