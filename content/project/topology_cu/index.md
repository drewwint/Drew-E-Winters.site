title: Brain Network Topology Underlying Socio-Affective Function and Callous-Unemotional Trait
summary: This project seeks to leverage advanced network connctivity approaches that capture the complexity of brain dynamics in order to understand socio-affective functioning and callous-unemotional traits assocaition with the brain from adolescence into adulthood.

The goal of this project is to leverage advanced and novel techniques to identify replicable neural mechanisms to improve our understanding of antisocial phenotypes with an emphasis on functional connections and dynamics in adolescent brains. This project aims to identify replicable mechanisms that could be used to develop and test new interventions.
