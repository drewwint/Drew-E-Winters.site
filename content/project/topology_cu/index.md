Goal: The research literature is mixed on developing a mechanistic understanding of socio-affective functioning and its impairments in adolescents. This project aims to use advanced novel techniques to identify neural mechanisms to improve our mechanistic understanding of these processes with an emphasis on functional connections in adolescent brains.
