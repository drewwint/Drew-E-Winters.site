Goal: Currently, the available treatments for adolescents with antisocial phenotypes are largely unsuccessful, especially long term. Moreover, the current state of the literature presents with a relatively underdeveloped understanding of mechanisms underlying the core impairments of antisocial phenotypes in adolescents. One reason for this is that, as we have learned more about the brain, brain regions to not act in isolation but, rather, interact amongst a community of regions. Thus, it is important to understand the connectivity and functional dynamics within and between brain networks to better understand these traits. This project aims to use advanced and novel techniques to identify replicable neural mechanisms to improve our understanding of these processes with an emphasis on functional connections and dynamics in adolescent brains. This project aims to identify replicable mechanisms that could be used to develop and test new interventions.
