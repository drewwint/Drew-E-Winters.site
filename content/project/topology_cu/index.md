The goal of this project is to leverage novel and advanced methods to identify replicable neural mechanisms underlying antisocial phenotypes with an emphasis on functional connections and dynamics in brains ranging from adolescence into adulthood. This project aims to identify replicable mechanisms that could be used to develop and test new interventions.
