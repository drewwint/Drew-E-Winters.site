abstract: “**Background**” Experiencing poverty and financial difficulties are significant barriers to outcomes of permanency and placement stability. This is particularly true for children who are in out of home placements. The provision of concrete services is intended to meet concrete needs of families to address this barrier. However, little is known about how concrete services meet the needs of families in need of these services or if the use of concrete services is a viable treatment for children who are in out of home placements. “**Methods**” The present study examined differences between those who received and those who did not receive concrete services on factors of stability, child and caregiver traumatic stress, number of placements, and current out of home placement. Regression analysis examined the association between amount of concrete service spending and permanency. Then to test concrete services as an intervention for children in a current out of home placement, we used propensity score matching to match participants on characteristics that predicted whether they would receive concrete services. We then ran a hierarchical regression to test the treatment condition of concrete services with children who are in a current out of home placement. “**Results**” Participants who received concrete services were at a much higher level of need with significantly higher levels of traumatic stress and number of placements and lower levels of placement stability. The amount of money spent on concrete services was associated with increases in placement stability. And, children in a current out of home placement had an increase in placement stability when they received concrete services. “**Conclusions**” The present study is the first to evidence concrete service as a treatment for placement stability for children in current out of home placements. Spending on concrete services in addition to child welfare services improves a child’s current placement stability. This is an important finding with implications for improving child welfare services’ approach to those in their care with financial burdens.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study was an evaluation on the use of concrete services for famalies involved in Indiana Child Welfare Services. These study findings were used to change policy around the use of concrete services as a standard for Indiana Child Welfare Services.
