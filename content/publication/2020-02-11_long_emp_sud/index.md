abstract: Background. A deficit in either socio-cognitive or socio-affective components of empathy is associated with the severity of substance use by late adolescence. What remains unknown is how longitudinal changes in these components of empathy predict adolescent substance using behavior. Methods. This secondary data analysis used data that followed adolescents in outpatient treatment for substance use (n = 826) during treatment and at 6 months post-treatment. To examine cross-lagged effects of empathy on substance use over time, we used a latent basis growth curve model. Results. Increases in affective empathy predicted reduced substance use over time. However, cognitive empathy did not predict substance use after controlling for other covariates. Conclusions. Lower levels of affective empathy may indicate a developmental vulnerability for substance using behavior. Modifying affective empathy may be a viable treatment target for reducing adolescent substance use.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary:  We used growth curve modeling to examine the impact of empathy's trajectory on the trajectory of substance use in a sample of adolescents in substance use treatment.
