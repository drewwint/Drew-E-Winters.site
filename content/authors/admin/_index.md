bio: My research interests include mental and social health as well as their
  associated neural processes across the lifespan. In this vein, I am interested
  in applying quantitative methods to identify replicable neural mechanisms that
  may improve testing and development of interventions for youth with
  callous-unemotional traits.

Social functioning and the brain shapes how an individual interacts with their world - impacting their life trajectory and wellbeing. My mission is to understand how social functioning and associated neural processes influence mental health and social behavior as they change over development. In this vein, I am interested in how [executive functioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions) and [social cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_cognition) interact in relation to mental health and contribute to [phenotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype) associated with [antisocial behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-social_behaviour) (e.g. [callous-unemotional traits]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callous_and_unemotional_traits)) across adolescence and into adulthood. 

To investigate this, I use [functional neuroimaging]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_neuroimaging) and [network science]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science) as well as [structural equation]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_equation_modeling) and [growth curve]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_curve_(statistics)) models. I am passionate about how to apply these methods to improve statistical inferences and leveraging these methods to identify mechanisms that give rise to these phenomena. My overall goal is to define replicable brain mechanisms that underlie neurocognitive and socio-affective impairments associated with youth antisocial phenotypes. This is important because it would improve the way we design and test the efficacy of new interventions for these youth. 

I am a NIMH-funded T32 postdoctoral fellow in Developmental Psychobiology with the department of Psychiatry at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.
