My mission is to understand how social psychological constructs and associated neural processes influence social behavior as they change over development. Specifically, I am interested in how interactions between socio-affective and neurocognitive functioning relate to mental health and contribute to antisocial phenotypes (e.g., callous-unemotional traits) across adolescence and into adulthood. 
To understand these phenomena, I use functional neuroimaging, network science, as well as computational and longitudinal models. Methodologically, I am interested in how these methods are applied and how to leverage these methods to identify mechanisms using an open-science framework. My overall goal is to define replicable neural mechanisms underlying neurocognitive and socio-affective impairments underlying callous-unemotional traits that could be used to design and test the efficacy of new interventions for these youth. 
I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the NIMH-funded T32 postdoctoral training program in Developmental Psychobiology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.
