bio: My research interests include mental and social health as well as their
  associated neural processes across the lifespan. In this vein, I am interested
  in applying quantitative methods to identify replicable neural mechanisms that
  may improve testing and development of interventions for youth with
  callous-unemotional traits.

My mission is to understand how social functioning and associated neural processes influence mental health and social behavior as they change over development. In this vein, I am interested in how [executive functioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions) and [social cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_cognition) interact in relation to mental health and contribute to [phenotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype) associated with [antisocial behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-social_behaviour) (e.g. [callous-unemotional traits]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callous_and_unemotional_traits)) across adolescence and into adulthood. 

To investigate this, I use [functional neuroimaging]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_neuroimaging) and [network science]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science) as well as [structural equation]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_equation_modeling) and [growth curve]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_curve_(statistics)) models. I am passionate about how to apply these methods to improve statistical inferences and leveraging these methods to identify [mechanisms](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-319-24612-3_1562) that give rise to these phenomena. My overall goal is to define [replicable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility) brain mechanisms that underlie neurocognitive and socio-affective impairments associated with youth antisocial phenotypes. This is important because it would improve the way we design and test the efficacy of new interventions for these youth. 

I am a NIMH-funded T32 postdoctoral fellow in [Developmental Psychobiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychobiology) with the department of Psychiatry at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.
