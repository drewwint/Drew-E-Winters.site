bio: My research interests include mental and social health as well as their
  associated neural processes across the lifespan. In this vein, I am interested
  in applying quantitative methods to identify replicable neural mechanisms that
  may improve testing and development of interventions for youth with
  callous-unemotional traits.

My mission is to understand how social functioning and associated neural processes influence mental health and social behavior as they change over development. Specifically, I am interested in how interactions between socio-affective and neurocognitive functioning relate to mental health and contribute to antisocial phenotypes (e.g., callous-unemotional traits) across adolescence and into adulthood.

To understand these phenomena, I use functional neuroimaging, network science, as well as computational and longitudinal models. I am interested in how to apply these methods to improve statistical inference and leveraging these methods to identify mechanisms using an open science framework. My overall goal is to define replicable neural mechanisms underlying neurocognitive and socio-affective impairments associated with youth antisocial phenotypes that could be used to design and test the efficacy of new interventions for these youth.

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the NIMH-funded T32 postdoctoral training program in Developmental Psychobiology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.
